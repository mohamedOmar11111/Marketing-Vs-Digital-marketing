                <p>Marketing is much bigger than just social media, ads, or SEO. Digital marketing falls under the Promotion element — just one “P” in the classic 4Ps of Marketing:</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The 4Ps of Marketing</h2>
        <div class="box product">
            <h3>Product</h3>
            <p>What you are offering, its features, design, and value.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box price">
            <h3>Price</h3>
            <p>How you position it in terms of cost and value.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box place">
            <h3>Place</h3>
            <p>Where and how you deliver it to your customers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box promotion">
            <h3>Promotion</h3>
            <p>How you communicate and spread the word (and that’s where digital marketing comes in).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
        <p>When people equate “digital marketing” with “marketing,” they overlook critical areas like product strategy, pricing models, distribution channels, customer experience, and brand positioning.</p>
        <p><strong>True marketing is about creating value, building trust, and delivering solutions — not just running ads online.</strong></p>
        <p>It’s time we stop narrowing the conversation. Digital marketing is powerful, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle.</p>
